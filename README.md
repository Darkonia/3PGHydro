# 3PGHydro
3PG-Hydro is an update of the original 3PG Forest Growth model by Landsberg and Waring (1997) (DOI: 10.1016/S0378-1127(97)00026-1). 3PG-Hydro calculates on a daily timestep, includes a soil-water-model as well as a snow routine. Further information in the publication on 3PG-Hydro by Yousefpour and Djahangard (2021) (DOI: 10.3390/f12121729). 
3PG-Hydro is available as an R-package, coding done by Anja NÃ¶lte & Marc Djahangard.
Further improvements are anticipated (e.g., including a dynamic leaf fall model).
