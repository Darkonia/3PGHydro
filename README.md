# 3PGHydro
3PG-Hydro is now available as an R-package! Coding by Anja NÃ¶lte & Marc Djahangard.

3PG-Hydro is an update of the original 3PG Forest Growth model by Landsberg and Waring (1997) (DOI:10.1016/S0378-1127(97)00026-1). 3PG-Hydro calculates on a daily timestep, includes a soil-water-model, seperated soil evaporation calculation as well as a snow routine. Further information in the publication on 3PG-Hydro by Yousefpour and Djahangard (2021) (DOI:10.3390/f12121729).
Further improvements besides described in Yousefpour and Djahangard (2021) are a dynamic leaf fall and leaf growth model for decidious trees as well as dynamic CO2-concentration function that prdouces yearly values for historical period as well as climate change scenarios RCP2.6 & RCP8.5. Moreover, 3PG-Hydro integrates the stand volume & height calculation method as described in Forrester et al. (2021) (DOI:10.1007/s10342-021-01370-3). Therefore, the parameters from Forrester et al. (2021) can be used.
